Large events like sports games and concerts are some of the most exciting times for many fans, but also some of the most confusing. FanLink provides a platform for the participants to interact with the organizers of an event. By using FanLink, event organizers can connect with fans in a closer and more meaningful way, resulting in a far better experience. It provides a quick and efficient way to include all of the participants in a common online group, which they can join by simply entering a code that the organizers generate.
